        <p> Health code violations are one of the many things consumers look for in a restaurant before dining. Even a minimal violation and a less than “A” grade deters consumers from dining at a food place, however, for New York City pre-k to 12
          grade students, that may not be the case. </p>

        <p> With 1.1 million students, the New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE), through its 1800 schools, feeds more people (students and members of the community) every day than almost any other public institution in the country.</p>

        <p> Most school cafeterias remain open even after a violation that is deemed a “public health hazard”. The cafeterias are shut down and revamped when they have “Critical” violations like pests, rodents and fleas infestation or food
          temperature
          violations.</p>

        <p> Unlike restaurants, school cafeterias are not given a letter grade, but instead, a numeric scale is given based on the severity of violations.
          Federal law local health inspectors across the country to inspect school cafeterias twice every school year. Inspectors are to visit the cafeterias without warning and to examine the kitchen for evidence of rodents and vermin. They check
          whether the equipments are up to par for the right food temperature and ask workers questions about service.</p>

      <p> With coronavirus vaccinations ramping up, about 70-80% of students are expected to resume in-person learning in the fall and they will most definitely be needing these school cafeterias. </p>

      <p> In the first four months of 2021, there has been over 1,000 violations reported at more than 800 schools. Some schools have more than one violations, with one Manhattan school racking up eight different violations.</p>

      <p> Of those violations reported, 544 received a documented health code violation. And, a quarter of those documented were in the “critical” category.</p>

      <p> The analysis discovered that 139 schools kitchens and cafeterias either contained evidence of rodents and vermins including roaches, mice, rats and flies, or had food temperature violations, or were grossly unsanitary.</p>


      <p>Use the dropdown below to find out what the worst schools are across the borough and their violations. Staten Island is not included because it only has one critical violation</p>
